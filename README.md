# COVID Chronicles
<b>Attention:</b> This software project was developed during the <b>#CodevsCOVID19</b> hackathon. It is work in progress and has a lot of room for improvement, especially when it comes to mobile support. 
<br>
The spread of COVID-19 will go down in history. Graphics of the virus spread can thus fulfill an important purpose: During the crisis, visualizations help us understand the extent of the pandemic. And in hindsight, they serve as a powerful historic reminder.
<br>
Most of the COVID-19 maps published by media companies and researchers focus on the current situation. However, we believe that in order to understand this pandemic, additional context is necessary. 
COVID Chronicles visualizes the spread of the virus over time and sets these numbers into perspective by providing newspaper articles for each day. This representation provides a more detailed and more understandable overview than raw numbers or existing maps would.
<br>
The data is provided by John Hopkins CSSE and can be [found on Github](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). It is updated daily.
For newspaper articles, COVID Chronicles currently solely relies on articles of the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/). The publication has a global reputation for neutral and detailed coverage of the Corona pandemic. Future versions of COVID Chronicles might include more diverse and localized sources.
